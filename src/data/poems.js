      content: `Part I

The midnight tide rolled cold and deep beneath the moonâ€™s pale glow,
As a sailorâ€™s breeze, through mist and foam, began to softly blow.
And far below, the abyssal dark lay still and vast and deep,
Where ancient whispers stirred the waves and woke from restless sleep.

And I could see no shore ahead, nor any trace behind,
Just endless waves that met my gaze, as far as sight could find.

And I, the sole captain, let out a deep sigh,
As memories drifted like stars in the sky
Each echo of laughter, each sorrow once known,
Returned with the wind with a voice of its own.

The ship had seen far fiercer days,
Yet still I dread, through ocean haze,
The day we met the beast untamedâ€”
The scourge of sailors, the Kraken

The sun shone bright, the sea lay still,
When sudden rocked the ship at will.
Barrels crashed and timber groaned,
As fear took root in flesh and bone.

Then from the depths, the waters swayed,
As twisting limbs rose up and flayed.
It wrapped the hull in crushing bands,
And tore the deck with giant hands.

The crew stood still, too scared to flee,
For they all knewâ€”could it be?
The myths were true, the sailors' bane,
The mighty Kraken rose again.

Then I atlast gave out a cry,
And under me, the crew stood high.
The cannons roared, the powder burned,
As iron shot, the beast had turned.

For every limb it tried to land,
Our guns struck back with steady hand.
For thirty minutes raged the fight,
Till stores ran low and hope grew tight.

The deck lay red with fallen men
Their blood mixed with foe and friend
Shattered bones and tattered skin
A gruesome dance of death and sin

Our chances waned, our fate seemed grim,
Yet still the beast was growing dim.
With one last heave, it rose once more,
Its ghastly face just near the shore.

It watched us now with blazing eyes
Longing to witness our slow demise

For all we knew that we were weak
And couldn't defeat the beast beneath
No strength was left no hope to seek
Untill Richard leapt into the deep

Unnoticed he crept up till its eyes
Till it was late for the beast to hide.
Cause then he stabbed with his silver knife
Into it's eyes once, twice and thrice.

The Kraken wailed, the sea turned red,
As Richard carved and struck its head.
And as it thrashed in wounded throes,
The cheers rose loud, the vict'ry close.

Yet fate had done the most gruesome deed
The Kraken took hold of Richards lead
He tried his best to save himself
Yet defeated by the krakens rage.

We watched in horror, helpless, still,
As silence bent to Krakenâ€™s will.
His muffled screams, his pleading eyes,
Met only with the oceanâ€™s cries.

Till at last, his struggles waned,
His weary limbs no longer strained.
One final gasp, one final glance,
Before the sea stole his final chance.

The kraken with its dying breath
Dragged him down to their death
They sank into the deep dark sea
Until all became quiet beneath

The fight was done that was sure
Yet grief now weighed on all the crew
For in our quest to slay the beast
We fed the sea a bloody feast.

The deck was slick with blood and brine,
With severed hands and twisted spines.
Men lay strewn with lifeless eyes,
Their final screams still haunt the skies.

      content: `I have spent all of the love I saved
we were always a losing game
when I saw u smile that way
It reminded me of the forgotten old days

Yet this smile was for some other
Unlike the ones which were just meant for me
during the nights we saw each other
and spent hours under the sweet cherry tree

And i know this to be true
that your love for me has faded
just like the name of mine which you drew
Etched on your heart has eroded

Yet I am a fool to believe once more
That time will rewind, and our love will restore
That you might hold me as you did before, 
But my hopes deceive me, nothing more.

When I see you with all the rest
I see how your love for me has died
I was just another flower for you
to pluck admire and cast aside.

      title: "End of Everything",
      content: `I strolled down the empty lane
The moon shadowing the path ahead
I watched the darkness and the rain.
Loneliness whispering in my head.

The darkness consumed everything
The rain drops drowned the world beside
And i continued to walk
Alone, under the dark sky

Alone I thought, my present, my past
My sorrow, my misery, closing in alas
Alone, betrayed, a cursed outcast
Just working each day till my very last

The empty streets stretched cold and vast
Each step I took felt like my last.
I reached my home, unlocked the hatch
And stood in silence, my heart detached.

For, tonight the room gazed back at me eerily
With a silence both horrifying and deafening
Reminding me of laughter that once filled its space
It stood now with eyes cold, remorse, staring

The night grew darker as I got lost in my mind
"Am I just a name, forgotten,  left behind?
If I, today, take my final breath
Will anyone mourn my silent death?"

And I fell into the deep dark abyss
Of thoughts, memories and broken dreams
Led a life forsaken, gone amiss.
Whilst I silenced my internal screams.

The storm outside howled no less
The sky, a shade of blackend haze
As I sat in utter darkness
Reliving my life with tears ablaze

The bottle beside fell under my glance
And taunted my life, my lonely stance
Drew me closer and lured me in
Promising, whispering a peaceful sin

Slowly i succumbed to my buried desires
Took the needle, no hope inside.
Stared ahead as I felt the fires
Of euphoric joy coursing inside

And a sudden thought went through my mind
A choice to save me cruel yet kind
And a sudden shock went down my spine
The need and feel to end the night

What good is wealth? What good is power?
They couldn't bring my brightest hour.
My joy has faded through the years,
No reason left to dry my tears.

For it didn't matter whether I lived or died
Happiness left me long behind
So why wait till the end of time
When I could end it all tonight

With trembling hands and tearful eyes
I took it all in, no more goodbyes,
And in the distance, soft yet clear,
My mother's call rang in my ear.

I ran to her as I had once before, 
Falling into her arms once more.
I crumbled beneath the darkened skies.
As Death gazed down with empty eyes.
