        "description": "Ever wondered how to build a machine learning model from the ground up? Here, we're diving into linear regression â€” a super straightforward way to predict numbers based on data. Think house prices, stock prices, or even something like predicting temperature. Linear regression fits a straight line through your data, then adjusts that line to get as close as possible to the right answers.",

        "description": "In my article 'Customizing Linux Terminal: Fastfetch, Not Neofetch,' I introduce Fastfetch as a superior alternative to Neofetch for displaying system information in the Linux terminal. I explain why Fastfetch is faster, more customizable, and lightweight compared to Neofetch. The article covers installation, configuration, and how to personalize the output to enhance the terminal experience.",

        "description": "In my article 'TIOBE is Trash: Why It Gets More Credit Than It Deserves & What to Use Instead,' I critique the TIOBE Index for being an unreliable measure of programming language popularity. I highlight its flawed methodology, which relies on search engine queries that can be misleading. Instead, I recommend better alternatives like the PYPL Index and Stack Overflow Developer Survey, which provide a more accurate picture based on actual usage and developer interest.",
